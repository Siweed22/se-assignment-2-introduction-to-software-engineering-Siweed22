Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Sofware engineering is the systematic application and principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high -quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deploying, and maintenance of the software products (powerlearnproject, 2024).

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 

Software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, and maintenance of complex computer programs such as computer games, business applications, operating systems, network control systems. Software engineering encompasses not just the act of writing code, but all of the tools and processes an organization uses to build and maintain that code over time. Software engineering can be thought of as 'programming integrated over time ( Winters et al., 2020), often working in teams. Software engineering oversee the development process while in traditional programming the responsibilities are of taking the software engineer’s guidelines and developing the programs and software. It is occasionally called “coding” or even “developing” as the primary focus is writing, evaluating and editing lines of code.Tranditional programmering is involved in a single stage within the development life cycle and concentrate on one component at a time. ( Heinz, 2022) 

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

The software development life cycle (SDLC) is the process of planning, writing, modifying, and maintaining software. The methodology is used to design and write modern software for computers, cloud deployment, mobile phones, video games, and more.In IT, the term "life cycle" was first used in the 1950s and 1960s to describe the stages involved in developing a new computer system, but it is now commonly used to refer to all stages in the production of any type of software.(Coursera Staff, 2024). SDLC is essentially a well-organized series of stages/phases that allows a corporation to quickly generate elevated software that has been properly tested and therefore is fully functional, they ssist in the reduction of costs, in the shortest period of time possible.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

In the Software Develoment Life Cycle(SDLC) there are verious phases 1) Requirement - During this phase, all the relevant information is collected from the customer to develop a product as per their expectation. Any desires and obstacles must be resolved in this phase, for example the client wants a cash app. In this case, the requirement has to be cleared, what kind of transactions will be done, how it will be done, in which currency it will be done. 2)Design - In this phase, the requirement gathered are used as an input,creating high-level, detailed design on software architecture on user interface. 3)Implementation  - all the design specifications are translated into source code. 4) Testing - conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements. 5) Deployment - Releasing the software to be used. 6) Maintenance -Providing ongoing support, updates enhancements. (Vijay & Swati , 2024)

Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 

Waterfall Model is a sequential approach where each stage must be finalized prior to the commencement of the subsequent one flowing downwards like a waterfall while Agile iterative and incrementral approch  on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall is linear and sequential, each phase must be completed before the next begins, has a clear structure and documentation and easy to manage due to its rigidity on the downside, it is difficult to accommodate changes and testing occurs late in the process. The waterfall model is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal changes expected. 


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
