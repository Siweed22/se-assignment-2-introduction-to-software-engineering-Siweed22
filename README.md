Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 

Sofware engineering is the systematic application and principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high -quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deploying, and maintenance of the software products (powerlearnproject, 2024). 

The difference between Software engineering and traditional programming is that software engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, and maintenance of complex computer programs such as computer games, business applications, operating systems, network control systems. Software engineering includes not just writing code, but all the tools and processes an organization uses to build and maintain that code over time. Software engineering can be thought of as 'programming integrated over time (Winters et al., 2020), often working in teams. Software engineering oversees the development process while in traditional programming the responsibilities are of taking the software engineer’s guidelines and developing the programs and software. It is occasionally called “coding” or even “developing” as the primary focus is writing, evaluating and editing lines of code. Traditional programming is involved in a single stage within the development life cycle and concentrates on one component at a time. (Heinz, 2022)

( Heinz, 2022) 


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

In the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) there are various phases 1) Requirement - During this phase, all the relevant information is collected from the customer to develop a product as per their expectation. Any desires and obstacles must be resolved in this phase, for example the client wants a cash app. In this case, the requirement has to be cleared, what kind of transaction will be done, how it will be done, in which currency it will be made. 2)Design - In this phase, the requirements gathered are used as an input, creating high-level, detailed design on software architecture on user interface. 3) Implementation - all the design specifications are translated into source code. 4) Testing - conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements. 5) Deployment - Releasing the software to be used. 6) Maintenance -Providing ongoing support, updates enhancements. (Vijay & Swati, 2024) 

Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall is linear and sequential, each phase must be completed before the next begins, has a clear structure and documentation and easy to manage due to its rigidity. On the downside, it is difficult to accommodate changes and testing occurs late in the process (powerlearnproject, 2024). The waterfall model is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal changes expected.  

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach, emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Quick response to change, regular customer feedback and improved team collaboration. On the downside is less predictability and requires significant customer involvement (powerlearnproject, 2024). Best suited for ongoing projects and projects where certain details are not known from the outset.  

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirement engineering is a process it is the process of identifying - like doing a technical, operational, and economic feasibility study. eliciting - interviews, brainstorming, task analysis, Delphi technique, prototyping, etc. analyzing , specifying - documenting the requirements identified in the analysis step in a clear, consistent, and unambiguous manner. The goal of this step is to create a clear and comprehensive document that describes the requirements for the software system. validating - This can include testing the software system through simulation, testing with prototypes, and testing with the final version of the software, and managing  - This involves monitoring and controlling changes to the requirements throughout the development process  keeping track of different versions of the requirements document and other related artifacts, monitoring the progress and reporting on the status of the requirements, etc. (geeksforgeeks, 2024). 

Requirement Engineering is the most important phase of the Software Development Life Cycle. This phase is used to translate the imprecise, incomplete needs and wishes of the potential users of software into complete, precise, and formal specifications. The specifications act as the contract between the software users and the developers. Therefore, the importance of Requirement Engineering is enormous to develop effective software and in reducing software errors at the early stage of the development of software (TechRepublic, 2022). 
 
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity refers to the design approach that emphasizes the separation of concerns, where a complex software system is divided into smaller, loosely coupled modules. Each module performs a specific function or handles a particular feature, and they interact through well-defined interfaces. This improves the overall readability of the code, enabling developers to grasp its logic and architecture quickly. So, when changes or updates are required, developers can focus on individual modules without the need to understand the entire system, making maintenance more manageable and improving scalability (Institute of Data, 2024). 

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

In Unit Testing errors are detected individually from every component or unit by individually testing the components or units of software to ensure that they are fit for use by the developers. It is the smallest testable part of the software. In Integration Testing two or more modules which are unit tested are integrated to test i.e., technique interacting components, and are then verified if these integrated modules work as per the expectation or not, and interface errors are also detected. In System Testing complete and integrated Softwares are tested i.e., all the system elements forming the system are tested to meet the requirements of the system (GeeksforGeeks, 2024).

Software testing is important because if there are any bugs or errors in the software, they can be identified early and fixed before the software product is delivered. A properly tested software product ensures dependability, security, and high performance, which leads to time savings, cost effectiveness, and customer satisfaction (Parthiban, 2024).

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are a category of software tools that help in recording changes made to files by keeping track of modifications done in the code. The software helps the developer team to efficiently communicate and manage(track) all the changes that have been made to the source code along with the information like who made and what changes have been made (GeeksforGeeks, 2022). 

In software developmenta a product is developed in collaboration by a group of developers. They might be located at different locations and each one of them contributes to some specific kind of functionality/features. So, to contribute to the product, they made modifications to the source code. A separate branch is created for every contributor who made the changes, and the changes are not merged into the original source code unless all are analyzed as soon as the changes are green signaled, they merged to the main source code. It not only keeps source code organized but also improves productivity by making the development process smooth. Basically, keeps track on changes made on a particular software and take a snapshot of every modification (GeeksforGeeks, 2022).

popular version control systems.
Git: tracks history, free and open source, supports collaboration, branching is easier 
Helix Core: enables businesses to monitor and manage changes across videos, binary files, IPs, codes and other digital assets via a unified portal 
Microsoft TFS: source code management, reporting, requirements management, project management, automated builds, lab management, testing and release management capabilities.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

responsibilities of a project manager range from invisible activities like building up team morale to highly visible customer presentations. Most of the managers take responsibility for writing the project proposal, project cost estimation, scheduling, project staffing, software process tailoring, project monitoring and control, software configuration management, risk management, managerial report writing, and presentation, and interfacing with clients (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). 

The project management challenges most commonly faced by a project manager include misalignment between goals and business objectives, communication, lack of accountability, resource allocation, scope creep, project management software, poor planning and unrealistic deadlines (Robert Kazmi, 2024) 

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software Maintenance refers to the process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customer to ensure that the software continues to meet the needs of the users over time (GeeksforGeeks, 2024).

types of maintenance. 1) Corrective Maintenance: This involves fixing errors and bugs in the software system.  2)Patching: It is an emergency fix implemented mainly due to pressure from management. Patching is done for corrective maintenance but it gives rise to unforeseen future errors due to lack of proper impact analysis. 3) Adaptive Maintenance: This involves modifying the software system to adapt it to changes in the environment, such as changes in hardware or software, government policies, and business rules. 4) Perfective Maintenance: This involves improving functionality, performance, and reliability, and restructuring the software system to improve changeability. 5) Preventive Maintenance: This involves taking measures to prevent future problems, such as optimization, updating documentation, reviewing and testing the system, and implementing preventive measures such as backups (GeeksforGeeks, 2024). 

Maintenance is an essential part Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) to update the software application and do all modifications in software application so as to improve performance is the main focus of software maintenance. Software is a model that runs on the basis of the real world. so, whenever any change requires in the software that means the need for real-world changes wherever possible (GeeksforGeeks, 2024).

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

ethical issues that software engineers might face is addictive design , corporate ownership of personal data, algorithmic bias, weak cyber security, and personally identifiable information (PII) protection, and overemphasis on features (Lawton, 2020). ( Facebook,instergram and tiktok have all been taken to court agaist accusations of ethical violations)

software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards by implementing key steps such as developing an ethical framework, involving experts, prioritizing transparency, educating employees and users, and conducting regular audits can ensure ethical behavior throughout the organization. With ethical decision-making as the cornerstone, the tech industry can create a brighter and more trustworthy future for all (MoldStud, 2024).
